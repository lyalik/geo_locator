## Backend API Endpoints Created

### Violations API
- `GET /api/violations/list` - Retrieve violations for analytics

### Satellite API
- `GET /api/satellite/sources` - Available satellite sources
- `GET /api/satellite/analyze` - Satellite data analysis
- `GET /api/satellite/image` - Satellite image retrieval
- `GET /api/satellite/time-series` - Time series data
- `GET /api/satellite/change-detection` - Change detection

## Technical Implementation Details

### Global Data Storage
- Implemented persistent global storage for violation results
- Analytics components prioritize real uploaded data over mock data
- Seamless integration between batch and single upload results

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for unavailable APIs
- Comprehensive error logging and user feedback
- Mock data fallbacks for development/demo purposes

### Data Flow
1. **Upload Phase**: Violations stored in global JavaScript variables
2. **Analytics Phase**: Components retrieve and analyze real data
3. **API Integration**: Backend provides additional context and metadata
4. **Visualization**: Charts and metrics display real violation statistics

## Production Readiness
